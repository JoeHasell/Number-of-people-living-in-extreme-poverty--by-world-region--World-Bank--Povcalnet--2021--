This folder takes the csv of our bulk-uploaded Povcal dataset (https://owid.cloud/admin/datasets/5276) and adds observations of the total number of people in extreme poverty for the South Asia region, by subtracting the total number in all other world regions from the total for the world.

This is then uploaded as a separate dataset in the grapher: https://owid.cloud/admin/datasets/4096.
